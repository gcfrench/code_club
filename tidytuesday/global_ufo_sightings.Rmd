> This script creates a heatmap of the number of UFO sightings in the UK for each day of the week.

```{r}
ufo_sightings_raw <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-06-25/ufo_sightings.csv")
```

First of all I am only interested in UFO sightings in the UK. Filtering on the city_area field produces more sightings than using the country field

```{r}
ufo_sightings_uk <- ufo_sightings_raw %>% 
  filter(str_detect(city_area, "uk/"))
```

This leaves us with 2,354 sightings. I am interested in counting the number of hourly sightings for each day, across all years so need to use the date_time column to extract days and hour columns.

I couldn't find a quick way of converting the hours to 12 hour labels and resorted to using lubridate's am and pm functions, addeing the midnight and midday labels afterwards.

Note I also set the start of the week as Monday rather than Sunday so that Sunday occurs at the end of the week. 

```{r}
ufo_sightings_uk_counts <- ufo_sightings_uk %>% 
  transmute(date_time = parse_date_time(date_time, "mdy HM")) %>% 
  mutate(hour = case_when(
     am(date_time) ~ str_glue("{hour(date_time)} am"),
     pm(date_time) ~ str_glue("{hour(date_time) -12} pm"),
     TRUE ~ NA_character_
  )) %>% 
  mutate(hour = as.character(hour)) %>%
  mutate(hour = case_when(
     hour == "0 am" ~ "midnight",
     hour == "0 pm" ~ "midday",
     TRUE ~ hour
  )) %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(date_time, label = TRUE, 
                        week_start = 1)) %>% # set Monday as the start of the week
  select(-date_time)
```

Now to count the number of UFO sightings per hour for each weekday and spread dataset by weekdays

```{r}
ufo_sightings_uk_counts <- ufo_sightings_uk_counts %>%
  group_by_all() %>% 
  tally(name = "ufo_sightings") %>% 
  ungroup()

ufo_sightings_uk_counts <- ufo_sightings_uk_counts %>%
  spread(weekday, ufo_sightings, fill = 0L) %T>% 
  glimpse()
```

The data frame is now in the format needed to produce a heatmap, apart from the ordering of the hours is not what I would like

To order the row going upwards from 1am to midnight I converted the hour column to an orderd factor giving the required order. To make midnight the first row I then had to reverse the order!

```{r}
hour_order <- c("1 am", "2 am", "3 am", "4 am", "5 am", "6 am", "7 am", "8 am", 
                "9 am", "10 am", "11 am", "midday", 
                "1 pm", "2 pm", "3 pm", "4 pm", "5 pm", "6 pm", "7 pm", "8 pm", 
                "9 pm", "10 pm", "11 pm", "midnight")

ufo_sightings_uk_counts <- ufo_sightings_uk_counts %>% 
  mutate(hour = factor(hour, levels = hour_order)) %>% 
  mutate(hour = fct_rev(hour)) %>% 
  arrange(hour)
```

Now to create the heatmat using the pheatmap package. To make the hours with the highest number of sightings look hotter I defined my own color palatte using the RColorBrewer package. With increasing sightings the palette goes from white, through yellow and orange to red having the highest number of sightings.

```{r}
heatmap_palette <- colorRampPalette(c("white", "yellow", "orange", "red"))(n = 77)
palette_breaks <- c(seq(0, 10, length = 10),
                    seq(11, 30, length = 19),
                    seq(31, 55, length = 24),
                    seq(56, 80, length = 24))

ufo_matrix <- data.matrix(ufo_sightings_uk_counts)[, -1]
rownames(ufo_matrix) <- ufo_sightings_uk_counts$hour
ufo_uk_sightings <- pheatmap(mat = ufo_matrix, 
                             cluster_row = FALSE, cluster_cols = FALSE,
                             display_numbers = TRUE, number_format = "%.0f", 
                             fontsize_number = 6, number_color = 'black',
                             angle_col = 0,
                             cellheight = 15, cellwidth = 30,
                             gaps_row = 6, gaps_col = 5,
                             border_color = 'black',
                             col = heatmap_palette,
                             breaks = palette_breaks,
                             legend = FALSE,
                             main = "UFO sightings in the UK (1943-2014)")
```

It appears that aliens are more likely to want to visit the UK for a night out, especially on a Saturday night. Look out for unexplained flying objects when you are next on a night out!

Finally lets save the heatmap as a png image.

```{r}
save_pheatmap <- function(x, filename, width = 1000, height = 1000, res = 150) {
   png(filename, width = width, height = height, res = res)
   grid::grid.newpage()
   grid::grid.draw(x$gtable)
   dev.off()
}
save_pheatmap(ufo_uk_sightings, "ufo_uk_sightings.png")
```
